# CRC User Manual

Source code for the official CRC user manual.

## Quick Start

Start by installing the project dependencies:

```bash
pip isntall -r requirements.txt
```

To generate a live preview locally, use the `serve` command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

A new version of the documentation is built and pushed to production every time the main branch is updated.
