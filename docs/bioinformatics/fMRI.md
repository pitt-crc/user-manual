# fMRI data analysis


Bioinformatics workshops - Fall 2023

An Introduction to Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis

Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023, 12:30pm - 3:30pm

In recent times, there has been a surge in neuroimaging research utilizing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). This research has generated a vast amount of complex fMRI data characterized by intricate spatiotemporal patterns. This workshop aims to guide attendees through the complex preprocessing steps and the subsequent statistical analysis of task-based and resting-state fMRI data. Additionally, we will discuss some latest trending research topics in human brain mapping via fMRI. Presented by Tingting Zhang
