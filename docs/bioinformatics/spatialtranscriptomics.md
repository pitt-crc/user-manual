<h2><strong>Spatial Transcriptomics WORKSHOP 6 </strong></h2>

<p><strong>Oct. 7, Monday, 1:00pm - 4:00pm</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Single-Cell Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis (ScSTA) Cookbook</strong><br />
<br />
This workshop aims to provide attendees with comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in the data analysis of sub-cellular resolution single-cell spatial transcriptomics (ScST) technologies such as Nanostring CosMx and 10X Genomics Xenium. We will start with an introduction to the components of ScST, including image registration, cell segmentation, cell type identification, spatial gene expression analysis, and more. A hands-on guided tutorial using real-world lung adenocarcinoma and COVID-19 datasets will follow. Presented by<strong> Arun Das</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Spatial Transcriptomics WORKSHOP 7 </strong></h2>

<p><strong>Oct. 8, Tuesday, 1:00pm - 4:00pm</strong></p>

<p><strong>10X Genomics Xenium data analysis</strong></p>

<p>The hands-on session will provide a solid foundation for handling and analyzing 10x Genomics Xenium datasets. We will begin with the Xenium onboard analysis ranger to conduct initial data exploration and quality assessment. Following this, we will move on to a downstream analysis pipeline using the Seurat workflow, which includes data import, quality control, dimension reduction and clustering, visualization and integration. We will also briefly cover advanced topics including cell segmentation, cell type deconvolution and integration with single cell data. Presented by <strong>Dhivyaa Rajasundaram</strong></p>
