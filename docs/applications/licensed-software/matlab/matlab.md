# MATLAB Software

MATLAB is a programming and numeric computing platform developed and distributed by 
[Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com/)

CRC users can access this software by means of the module loading system on the cluster, or via 
[MATLAB Remote Job Submission](matlab-remote-job-submission.md). 

The most recent MATLAB version available on CRC is **R2023a**. Newer versions such as R2025a will be available on our new systems after upgrade to RHEL 9.

See [the instructions on accessing VIZ](../../../web-portals/viz.md) for an example of opening MATLAB on those machines.

There are also specific instructions for [using MATLAB via Open OnDemand](../../../web-portals/open-ondemand.md). See 
the MATLAB section under GUI Apps.

To use MATLAB on the CRC clusters, you **do not** need to purchase an annual research license.

PIs should indicate whether users created under their allocation require access to MATLAB.

!!! note

    When you are launching Matlab for the first time, a new cache will be built which could take up to five minutes 
    before Matlab is ready for use. All subsequent launches should be a lot faster. Please also make sure that your 
    home as well as the local launch directory have sufficient storage space.

The Remote Job Submission method allows for users to submit MATLAB jobs directly to the clusters from a locally 
installed copy of MATLAB or from VIZ. This is facilitated by 
[Matlab Parallel Server](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-parallel-server.html).

This method is great for less experience users who are not as comfortable with the command line or for users who are 
having issues with resource intensive processing jobs completing successfully on their local machine or VIZ.
