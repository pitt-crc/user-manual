# MATLAB Remote Jobs Submission

MATLAB Parallel Server is a set of MATLAB functions that extend the capabilities of the MATLAB Parallel Computing 
toolbox to allow you to submit jobs from directly to a remote HPC cluster. 

This allows you to take full advantage of the computing power available on the CRC's clusters to perform complex 
parallelized computations in MATLAB. Parallel jobs can be submitted either from an SBATCH submission on the clusters 
or on your own computer with custom a set of custom scripts that integrate with Slurm. In fact, you must use the 
MATLAB Parallel Server if you want to run MATLAB jobs that span multiple nodes. 

When you submit a MATLAB Parallel Server job from your MATLAB desktop client, scripts and data are transferred to the 
cluster by MATLAB.  Results from jobs that run on the cluster are readily available to MATLAB running on your desktop. 

The instructions on this page are for people who want to interact with Parallel Server from their own local machine. 
Instructions for submitting MATLAB Parallel Server jobs using sbatch scripts on the compute node are available on the 
cluster: `/ihome/crc/how_to_run/matlab`

## Local Client Job Submission

### Prerequisites

1. Your MATLAB version must be at least R2021a. Plugin scripts are also available for MATLAB 2022a. If you don’t 
        have one of these versions, please visit the [Pitt IT Software Download Service](https://software.pitt.edu), 
        search for "MATLAB" and download and install R2021a or R2022a. Note: The 2022a plugin scripts seem to work 
        fine with previous versions, but will work best with 2022a MATLAB.
2. Make sure you are using the newest update of your version of MATLAB (Open MATLAB > "HOME" Tab > "RESOURCES" 
        Section> "Help" Drop Down > Check for Updates)
3. You must have the MATLAB **Parallel Computing Toolbox** installed. To see what toolboxes are 
        installed, type the `ver` command in the MATLAB command window. You should see `Parallel Computing Toolbox`
        listed. If you don't, you can open MATLAB > go to the home tab > Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons > Search for 
        `Parallel Computing Toolbox` and Install (If you are using MATLAB licensed through the university).
4. You must be connected to the CRC VPN in order to submit jobs from your desktop, if you are off-campus. 
        Please visit [this page](https://services.pitt.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=293) on installing 
        the vpn.

### Download the Cluster Plugin Scripts

In order to submit jobs from your desktop, you will need to install some custom MATLAB plugin scripts that know how to 
interact with the Slurm job scheduler on a cluster. Use the link below to download the **non-shared** filesystem 
(used by your local client, you should not use them on the clusters as they **share **a filesystem with 
the MATLAB installation that is running the jobs) script bundle for your version of MATLAB:

[Pitt.h2p.R2022a.zip](https://crc.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Pitt.nonshared.R2022a.zip) (recommended)

[Pitt.h2p.R2021a.zip](https://crc.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Pitt.nonshared.R2021a.zip) 

!!! note

    The instructions below have been updated to correspond to the R2022a plugin scripts. 
    Some cluster object fieldnames have changed. Changes from the previous scripts will have comments next to them.

### Unpack the Cluster Plugin Bundle to a Path on Your Computer

Copy the integration bundle file to a new folder on your computer, such as `Downloads/matlab-parallel-server`. 
Unpack the plugin bundle file into the path you choose.

### Run the configCluster.m Script to Create a Cluster Profile

Open MATLAB. In the Current Folder window, navigate to the path where you unpacked one of the cluster plugin bundles. 
In that path, find the Matlab script called `configCluster.m`.  Run this script by right-clicking on the name and 
selecting Run. (If MATLAB asks you if you want to add the path to your environment, select Add Path.)

Submission to the remote cluster requires SSH credentials. The `configCluster` script will prompt you to enter the 
username you use to log in to the cluster.  Just enter your Pitt username in lower case (e.g. abc123).  You should not 
append "@pitt.edu" to it. The script also asks you your group name on H2P cluster. If you do not know what your group 
name is, login to the cluster and run the following command:

`finger <your Pitt username>` 

For example:

```commandline
[shs159@login1 ~]$ finger shs159 
Login: shs159                                      Name: shs159
Directory: /ihome/pgivi/shs159             Shell: /bin/bash
On since Tue Aug  3 15:06 (EDT) on pts/124 from login0.crc.pitt.edu
   4 days idle
No mail.
No Plan.
[shs159@login1 ~]$
```

Here in `/ihome/<your group>/<your username>`, the first subdirectory is your group name and the second directory one 
step further is your Pitt username.

After you enter your username and your group name, the program will display an informational reminder that you will 
need to set the `NumNodes` and `WallTime` parameters before you can submit a job. We'll cover how to set job parameters 
in the next section.  A screenshot of a successful run of `configCluster` is shown below:

<!-- TODO: replace with image hosted in assets -->

Jobs will now default to the cluster rather than submit to the local machine.

!!! note 

    If you would like to submit to the local machine then run the following command:

    ```Matlab
    >> % Get a handle to the local resources
    >> c = parcluster('local');
    ```

## Working with Cluster Objects

Using cluster objects is central to using MATLAB Parallel Server.  The **parcluster** command is used to initialize a 
cluster object for your session:

```Matlab
>> c=parcluster
c = 
 Generic Cluster
    Properties: 
                   Profile: h2p R2022a     
                  Modified: false
                      Host: localhost
                NumWorkers: 100000
                NumThreads: 1
        JobStorageLocation: /Users/shervin.sammak/MdcsDataLocation/h2p/Shervins-MBP.fios-router.home/R2022a/remote
         ClusterMatlabRoot: /ihome/crc/install/matlab/R2022a
           OperatingSystem: unix
   RequiresOnlineLicensing: false
     PluginScriptsLocation: /Users/shervin.sammak/Documents/MATLAB/IntegrationScripts/h2p
      AdditionalProperties: List properties
    Associated Jobs: 
            Number Pending: 0
             Number Queued: 0
            Number Running: 3
           Number Finished: 0
>> myjob2 = batch(c,'plot_sine','AutoAddClientPath' ,false, 'CurrentFolder', './test');
 3x1 Job array: 
         ID           Type        State              FinishDateTime        Username  Tasks
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1     2    independent      running                              shervin.sammak      1
    2     3           pool     finished                              shervin.sammak     40
    3     4           pool     finished                              shervin.sammak      9
```


 

Above, we first created a cluster object `c` using the 'Pitt h2p R2022a' profile.  Then, we entered 'c' without a 
semicolon to see the list of properties in the cluster object. Notice that there is a very important subset of 
properties called `AdditionalProperties`.  You will need to modify some of these properties values to actually submit a 
job to Slurm.  Let's examine the AdditionalProperties:

```Matlab
>> c.AdditionalProperties
ans = 
  AdditionalProperties with properties:
                 AccountName: ''
        AdditionalSubmitArgs: ''
                 ClusterHost: 'h2p.crc.pitt.edu'
                 ClusterName: 'smp'
                EmailAddress: ''
                 EnableDebug: 0
                     Feature: ''
                 GpusPerNode: 0
                    MemUsage: ''
                       Nodes: 0 % Was NumNodes
                ProcsPerNode: 0
                   Partition: '' % Was QueueName 
    RemoteJobStorageLocation: '/ihome/pgivi/shs159/MdcsDataLocation/h2p/Shervins-MBP.fios-router.home/R2022a/remote'
                 Reservation: ''
             % UseIdentityFile Removed
                     UseSmpd: 0
                    Username: 'shs159'
                    WallTime: ''

>>
```

As you can see, when you first create the cluster object, many of the properties do not have values. As a minimum, set 
values for **Nodes (Default is 1)**, **ProcsPerNode (Default is 1), ClusterName (must be specified)**, and 
**WallTime (must be specified)**.  Optionally, you can set the **EmailAddress**, **Partition**, and 
**AdditionalSubmitArgs**.  The **AdditionalSubmitArgs** is used for passing any additional options to the 
Slurm sbatch command.   


## Examples

The examples below show how to use MATLAB Parallel Server to run

- serial (single CPU) jobs

- multiprocessor jobs on a single machine

- and distributed parallel jobs running on multiple nodes. 

If you'd like to download MATLAB scripts used in the examples, they are available here: 
<a href="/sites/default/files/tests.zip">tests.zip</a>

 

### Example 1: serial code

In the first example, we will run a simple MATLAB job that uses a single processor.  This program isn't parallelized, 
but we can still execute the job on the cluster.   We'll begin by creating a MATLAB script called `mywave.m` simply 
calculates a million points on a sine wave in a for loop. The file `mywave.m` has been created in our current MATLAB 
folder. The function is pretty simple:

```Matlab
%--  mywave.m --%
tic
for i = 1:1000000
    A(i) = sin(i*2*pi/102400);
end
toc
```

When you run this following commands in MATLAB, it should prompt you for your password for logging in to the cluster. 
Answer “No” to the question and then enter your Pitt password in the following window. MATLAB caches your password 
during this session, so you don't have to enter your again for submitting other jobs during the same MATLAB session.

```Matlab
>> c = parcluster;
>> c.AdditionalProperties.ClusterName = 'smp';
>> c.AdditionalProperties.WallTime='1-10:00:00'; %% 1 day and 10 hours wall-time. 
>> myjob = batch(c,'mywave','AutoAddClientPath',false);
additionalSubmitArgs =
'--ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --ntasks-per-core=1 --cluster smp'
```

<!-- TODO: replace with image hosted in assets -->

Then, you can monitor and retrieve data: 

```Matlab
>> myjob.State
ans =
'finished'
>> myjob.fetchOutputs
ans =
1×1 cell array
{1×1 struct}
>> myjob.load # this command loads all variables from the finished job
>> plot(A)
```

<!-- TODO: replace with image hosted in assets -->

### Example 2:  Parallel job on a single node

In the next example, we will run a parallel job using 8 processors on a single node.  We will be using a 
parallelized version of mywave.m called `par_wave.m` that uses the `parfor` statement to parallelize the previous 
for loop:

```Matlab
%--  parallel_mywave --%

% A parfor loop will use parallel workers if available.
tic
**parfor** i = 1:10000000
    A(i) = sin(i*2*pi/2500000);
end
toc
```

The `parfor` command will use a pool of workers to execute the loop in parallel if a worker pool exists. 
You can learn more about the use of 
[parfor loops on this page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/parfor.html).

Now we'll submit the job to the smp cluster, high-mem partition. Note that the batch command has changed significantly 
by adding a pool for 7+1 workers.  Note that these jobs will always request N+1 CPU cores, since one worker is required 
to manage the batch job and pool of workers. For example, a job that needs seven workers will consume eight CPU cores. 

```Matlab
>> c.AdditionalProperties.ClusterName = 'smp';

>> c.AdditionalProperties.Partition = 'high-mem'; % Was QueueName

>> myjob = batch(c,'par_wave','AutoAddClientPath',false,'Pool', 7);
```

### Example 3:  Parallel job on multiple nodes

In the next example, we will run a parallel job using 95 + 1 processors across two nodes. 

We will be using the same `par_wave.m` script from Example 2.

MPI jobs require a minimum of 2 Nodes, and must use the full amount of cores that each node offers. For example, a 2 
node MATLAB job submitted to the mpi partition (48 cores per node) of the MPI cluster needs to request 
(2 * 48) - 1 = 95 cores (MATLAB uses 1 worker core to handle background tasks in remote job submission). 

```Matlab
>> c.AdditionalProperties.ClusterName = 'mpi';
>> c.AdditionalProperties.Nodes = 2;
>> c.AdditionalProperties.Partition = 'mpi'; % Was QueueName
>> c.AdditionalProperties.WallTime='01:00:00'; %% 1 hour wall-time.
>> myjob = batch(c,'par_wave','AutoAddClientPath',false,'Pool', 95);
additionalSubmitArgs =
    '--ntasks=96 --cpus-per-task=1 --ntasks-per-core=1 --cluster mpi -N 2 -p mpi -t 01:00:00'
```

The above script submits `par_wave` to the `mpi` cluster's `mpi` partition with the total of 39+1 workers.

```Matlab
>> myjob.State
ans =
    'finished'
>> 
>> myjob.diary
--- Start Diary ---
Elapsed time is 1.297303 seconds.
--- End Diary ---
```

## FAQs

**Q: My job's .State value is 'failed'. How can I find more information?**

A: If a job produces an error, you can call the getDebugLog method to view the error log file.  When submitting 
independent jobs, with multiple tasks, specify the task number.

```Matlab
%Load parcluster

**Q: If I lose my VPN connection or put my local machine in sleep mode, can I still retrieve my jobs?**

A: Yes, this is as simple as calling parcluster again.

**Q: If my MATLAB script has created a file on the cluster, do I need to manually copy the file back onto my 
local machine?**

A: Yes, here's an example which plots a sine function and create a plot called `sine_wave.ps`:

```Matlab
% Plot the sine wave
disp('This script plots the sine wave');
x = -pi:.1:pi;
y = sin(x);
p = plot(x,y)
set(gca,'XTick',-pi:pi/2:pi)
set(gca,'XTickLabel',{'-pi','-pi/2','0','pi/2','pi'})
xlabel('-\pi \leq \Theta \leq \pi')
ylabel('sin(\Theta)')
title('Plot of sin(\Theta)')
% \Theta appears as a Greek symbol (see String)
% Annotate the point (-pi/4, sin(-pi/4))
text(-pi/4,sin(-pi/4),'\leftarrow sin(-\pi\div4)','HorizontalAlignment','left')
% Change the line color to red and
% set the line width to 2 points
set(p,'Color','red','LineWidth',2)
disp('Now outputing plot to sine_wave.ps');
print -deps sine_wave.ps;
exit;
```

This is the command to submit the job to the cluster:

```Matlab
myjob2 = batch(c,'plot_sine','AutoAddClientPath' ,false, 'CurrentFolder', './test');
additionalSubmitArgs =
'--ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --ntasks-per-core=1 --cluster smp -p smp'
```

The above script submit the `plot_sine` job to the smp cluster, partition smp where the figure will be saved 
in `/ihome/<your group>/<your Pitt username>/test`.

```Matlab
>> myjob2.diary
Warning: The diary of this batch job might be incomplete because the job is still running.

--- End Diary ---
>> 
```

**Q: Where are metadata files stored on my local machine?**

A: The cluster object has a field called JobStorageLocation that defines this:

`JobStorageLocation: C:\Users\Nicko\AppData\Roaming\MathWorks\MATLAB\3p_cluster_jobs\h2p\LAPTOP-H53N4LSB\R2022a\nonshared`

You can also access the metadata on the cluster with the `cluster.AdditionalProperties.RemoteJobStorageLocation` field:

`RemoteJobStorageLocation: '/ihome/sam/nlc60/.matlab/3p_cluster_jobs/h2p/LAPTOP-H53N4LSB/R2022a/nonshared'`

Please note that if you run `configCluster` again, all metadata will be lost on your local machine.

        command on remote host.
```

A: The command is failing on the remote host because you need to re authorize your connection with your username 
and password.

Reestablish your cluster object with the parcluster command, and then submit.

**Q: My submission to MPI yields the following error: "Your MPI job is not requesting the full number of cores on its 
nodes: 48 cores on the mpi partition" How do I resolve this?**

A: MPI jobs require a minimum of 2 Nodes, and must use the full amount of cores that each node offers. For example, a 
2 node MATLAB job submitted to the mpi partition (48 cores per node) of the MPI cluster needs to 
request (2 * 48) - 1 = 95 cores (MATLAB uses 1 worker core to handle background tasks in remote job submission). 

```Matlab
c.AdditionalProperties.Partition = 'mpi'

c.AdditionalProperties.Nodes = 2;

myjob = batch(c,'my_job','AutoAddClientPath', false, 'Pool', 95);
```

Will send the following job configuration to SBATCH:
```Matlab
'--ntasks=96 --cpus-per-task=1 --ntasks-per-core=1 --cluster mpi -N 2 -p mpi -t 01:00:00'
```
