# Supporting Code Optimization

Pitt CRCD faculty consultants offer support for optimizing users' code. 
However, the support may vary depending upon our available resources, and the 
volume and degree of the support needed. We ask that in your proposal you describe 
the level of support you will need, and an estimation of the duration of that 
support to allow our consultants to plan the most effective use of resources. 

Pitt CRCD consultants may also direct you toward workshops or other teaching 
resources in addition to or instead of direct consultation.
