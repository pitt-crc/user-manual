# **hugen or teach Open Ondemand webportal on the teach cluster**

## **Summary**

The hugen.crc.pitt.edu or teach.crc.pitt.edu Open Ondemand Web Portal is the gateway to CRC teach cluster to teach bioinformatics courses. Department of Human Genetics has paid part of the cost of this node. 

**[Log in to hugen or teach](https://hugen.crc.pitt.edu, https://teach.crc.pitt.edu)**

To access this portal, you need to have a [user account](https://crc.pitt.edu/getting-started#) within CRC.

The portal server is firewalled within PittNet and as such [you will need to be on VPN](https://crc.pitt.edu/user-support/resource-documentation/vpn-and-accessing-clusters) or be directly connected to PittNet via Ethernet.

Once connected, you can run commands directly on the server and submit batch jobs to the CRC clusters.

All CRC software can be accessed using a terminal and our LMOD software provisioning system.
