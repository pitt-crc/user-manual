# Data Management Overview

## File Systems

There are several distinct file spaces available on clusters, each serving a different function.

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/ihome </span>($HOME), the system housing home directories.

	<ul>
		<li>It contains sub-directories for each user group, and those contain individual user directories.</li>
		<li>Also referred to as the 'login directory' and is the entry point when a user logs into the CRC ecosystem</li>
		<li>75 GB quota that cannot be increased</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/ix</span> and <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/ix1</span>, enterprise storage locations for persistent file storage.
	<ul>
		<li>5 TB provisions for new allocations can be found here.</li>
		<li>There is no charge for a 5 TB provision on ix.</li>
		<li>If you do not have a location provisioned, <a href="https://services.pitt.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=yXkHi62rHa8_&RequestorType=Service">please let us know by submitting a ticket</a>.</li>
		<li>5 TB increments of extra storage are available for purchase at a subsidized rate of $65 per TB per year.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/bgfs</span>, a BeeGFS file system for persistent file storage that is no longer being provisioned on.</li>
	<li><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/zfs1</span> and <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">/zfs2</span>, 1 PB file systems for archival storage.</li>
</ul>

You can check your usage and quotas across these filesystems with the wrapper script command `crc-quota`:

```commandline
[nlc60@login0b ~] : crc-quota
User: 'nlc60'
-> ihome: 59.63 GB / 75.0 GB

Group: 'sam'
-> zfs1: 1.76 TB / 5.0 TB
-> beegfs: 14.68 TB / 80.0 TB
```

## File permissions 

Group project storage locations on `/ix`, `/bgfs`, `/zfs1`, or `/zfs2` can be requested via ticket. The top level folder is 
owned by `root:groupname` with 2770 permission. The 2 sets the sticky bit, group members have read + write permission, 
and `other` users cannot access the folder.

Access to files by the group members is governed by Unix file permissions.
For detailed information on Unix file protections, see the `man` page for the `chmod` command.

To share files with your group, give the group **read and execute** access for each directory from your top-level 
directory down to the directory that contains the files you want to share.
`chmod g+rx {directory-name}`

Then give the group read and execute access to each file you want to share.
`chmod g+rx {filename}`

To give the group the ability to edit or change a file, add write access to the group:
`chmod g+rwx {filename}`

If you want to share file with other group members or users, submit a help ticket, and we can use 
Access Control Lists (ACLs) – a more fine-grained control than Unix file permissions allow. 
The command for bgfs is `setfacl`, and for ZFS is `nfs4_setfacl`, more detailed help text can be viewed in 
their man pages.


## Shared Folders

`/ix` storage locations are only accessible to allocation owners and the users they sponsor (their "user group").

If you are working with collaborators that also have CRC user accounts, but are not in your user group, a shared folder 
under your `/ix` location can be used to facilitate sharing data between your groups.

These should be requested by [submitting a ticket](https://services.pitt.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=yXkHi62rHa8_&RequestorType=Service) 
and providing details about the users that need access.

This should include Pitt Usernames and specifics about the permissions they will require (read, write, execute, etc).


## Restoring Accidentally Deleted Files

`/ix`, `/zfs1`, and `/zfs2` keep snapshots for up to 7 days.

[Submit a help ticket](https://services.pitt.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=yXkHi62rHa8_&RequestorType=Service) 
with your request to restore data from snapshots.

**Snapshots are not available for `/bgfs` locations**

## Moving Data between your local machine and the CRC Clusters

### SFTP Clients

#### Cyberduck

CyberDuck is a popular open source SFTP client for Windows and Mac. 
Download and install Cyberduck. Open the Cyberduck application. 
Click the "Open Connection" button on the toolbar.

![](../_assets/img/data-management/cyberduck.png)

<ul>
	<li>Select "SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)" from the drop-down.</li>
	<li>Enter htc.crc.pitt.edu in the;Server;box.</li>
	<li>Enter your Pitt username and password, and click;Connect.</li>
</ul>

Your files on the server will appear in the CyberDuck window. 
You can now drag-and-drop files to and from the window to upload/download files.


#### FileZilla

FileZilla is cross-platform FTP application available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
Download and install FileZilla. Open the FileZilla application.

![](../_assets/img/data-management/FileZilla.png)

<ul>
	<li>Enter sftp://htc.crc.pitt.edu in the Host;box.</li>
	<li>Enter your Pitt username and password, and click;QuickConnect.</li>
</ul>

Your files on the server will appear in the FileZilla window. 

#### The Open OnDemand File App

Logon ondemand.htc.crc.pitt.edu, Click Files -> Home Directory, 
Click Upload and choose File(s) from your computer. Due to limited cache size, DO NOT use Ondemand File App to upload 
big files ( > 1 GB).

![](../_assets/img/data-management/ondemand.png)

#### Globus File Sharing

For large data sets, consider using [Globus](https://crc-pages.pitt.edu/user-manual/data-management/globus/).

An institutional endpoint is **not required** to use Globus; You can set up a personal endpoint on your computer if you 
need to transfer large amounts of data.

### Command Line Tools

#### rsync

You can use `rsync` from a terminal/shell on your local computer.

Copy **to** the cluster:
`rsync -aP {files} fangping@htc.crc.pitt.edu:/bgfs/sam/fangping/`

Where {files} is a local directory on your computer. This makes a recursive copy of the local files to a folder on the 
cluster.


Copy **from** the cluster:
`rsync -aP fangping@htc.crc.pitt.edu:/bgfs/sam/fangping/files/ .`

This copies the `/bgfs/sam/fangping/files` folder on the cluster to the working directory on the local machine.

#### scp
`scp` is similar to `rsync` in that it runs in a terminal on your local machine.

`scp -r files fangping@htc.crc.pitt.edu:/bgfs/sam/fangping/`

This copies the folder files in the current directory on the computer you issued the command on to a folder on the cluster.

`scp -r fangping@htc.crc.pitt.edu:/bgfs/sam/fangping/files/ .`

This copies the `/bgfs/sam/fangping/files` folder on the cluster to the current directory on the computer you issued 
the command from.

#### aspera

Aspera is IBM's high-performance file transfer software which allows for the transfer large files and data sets with 
predictable, reliable and secure delivery regardless of file size or transfer distance from a location that has the 
aspera transfer server running.&nbsp; The NCBI recommend the use of aspera for transfer of data sets from their site.

Download aspera from to your home directory on HTC cluster.

Download link: https://download.asperasoft.com/download/sw/connect/3.9.1/ibm-aspera-connect-3.9.1.171801-linux-g2.12-64.tar.gz

`tar xzvf ibm-aspera-connect-3.9.1.171801-linux-g2.12-64.tar.gz`

You will find file `ibm-aspera-connect-3.9.1.171801-linux-g2.12-64.sh`:

`./ibm-aspera-connect-3.9.1.171801-linux-g2.12-64.sh`

aspera is installed to `~/.aspera`

You can then use aspera to download files. 
The aspera binary is at `~/.aspera/connect/bin/ascp` and the key is at `~/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh`
```commandline
[fangping@login0b aspera]$ ~/.aspera/connect/bin/ascp -QT -l 300m -P33001 -i ~/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh era-fasp@fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR949/SRR949627/SRR949627_1.fastq.gz .
```

### Use wget or curl to Download Files

wget is a networking command-line tool that lets you download files. It supports the HTTP,HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS internet protocols.

In order to download a file using Wget, type wget followed by the URL of the file that you wish to download. Wget will download the file in the given URL and save it in the current directory.

wget https://what.ever

The equivalent curl command is:

curl https://what.ever

The file will keep the name embedded in the url.
You can specify a destination name.

curl -o newname https://what.ever

wget -O newname https://what.ever.

If your url includes specific characters, such as ?, you can put the full url in single quotes to prevent the shell from mangling these characters.

wget -O newname 'https://what.ever?userId=id&Credential=password’

curl -o newname 'https://what.ever?userId=id&Credential=password’


### Cloud Tools

#### Pitt OneDrive

You can transfer data between Pitt OneDrive and the cluster. 
See [this page](https://crc-pages.pitt.edu/user-manual/data-management/microsoft-onedrive/) for details.

#### Pitt Box

You can transfer data from and to Pitt box from the cluster. 
Follow [these steps](https://crc-pages.pitt.edu/user-manual/data-management/box/).


#### AWS S3

`awscli` has been installed as a module in Lmod. 
You can transfer data from the cluster to AWS S3.

`module load awscli/1.16.135`

`aws s3 sync /bgfs/sam/fangping/DataUpload s3://my-s3-bucket/data_from_htc`

This will transfer `/bgfs/sam/fangping/DataUpload` folder to `s3://my-s3-bucket/data_from_htc`

You can submit this command as a job on HTC computational node.

#### google bucket

You can install and configure `gsutil` to transfer data from/to gs bucket.

`module load gsutil/5.16`

`gsutil config`

`gsutil cp -r gs://gs-bucket-name/ .`

This will recursively transfer `gs://gs-bucket-name/` folder to the current folder.

#### Azure Storage

[AzCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10) is a command-line 
tool that moves data into and out of Azure Storage. `azcopy` has been installed as a module.

`module load azcopy/10.11.0`
`azcopy --help`

`azcopy copy "/bgfs/your/folder/" "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?sv=2018-03-28&amp;ss=bjqt&amp;srt=sco&amp;sp=rwddgcup&amp;se=2019-05-01T05:01:17Z&amp;st=2019-04-30T21:01:17Z&amp;spr=https&amp;sig=MGCXiyEzbtttkr3ewJIh2AR8KrghSy1DGM9ovN734bQF4%3D" --recursive=true`

This example command recursively copies data from a local directory to a blob container. A fictitious SAS token is 
appended to the end of the container URL.

You can submit this command as a job on HTC computational node.
