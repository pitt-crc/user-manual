# Step 1- Getting an Account

Access to the CRC Ecosystem requires a CRC account and an accompanying resource allocation. 
All active Pitt faculty, instructors, or center directors can request a resource allocation using the webform from
our [**service catalog**](https://crc.pitt.edu/service-request-forms). 

The CRC Ecosystem is hosted at the Pitt data center and is firewalled within PittNet. You will first need to establish 
a [**VPN**](https://services.pitt.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=293) in order to gain access.

!!! tip "Alternative Access Point: AVD"
    If after exhausting all troubleshooting avenues and the VPN remains non-functional, an alternative approach is to use an
    [**Azure Virtual Desktop**](access_avd.md) as a so-called *jump box* to CRC.

A schematic of this part of the process is highlighted below.
