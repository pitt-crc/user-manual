# Big Picture Overview

The University of Pittsburgh provides its research community access to high performance computing and data storage 
resources. These systems are maintained and supported through the Center for Research Computing (CRC) and Pitt IT.
To get started, you will need a CRC account, with which you will use to login to Access Portals to interact with 
the CRC Ecosystem.

A schematic of the process is depicted below.

<ins>**Definitions**</ins>

*   **Client** -- this is your computer or internet-connected device
*   **Access Portal** -- one of several remote servers used to submit jobs to the high performance computing clusters or to perform
data management operations
*   **CRC Ecosystem** -- the total footprint of the CRC infrastructure, including high performance computing 
clusters, data storage systems, networking equipment, and software
