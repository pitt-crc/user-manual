# nf-core Pipelines

Nextflow is a reactive workflow framework and a programming DSL that eases the writing of data-intensive computational pipelines.

*   Programming language to handle computational workflows, based on Groovy/Java
*   Well suited for complex and highly parallel Bioinformatics workflows
*   Easy to run/use
*   Handles interaction with compute infrastructure, runs just about anywhere

[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) is a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis [pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines) built using Nextflow.

I built a web application through open ondemand:

*   Choose a pipeline
*   Fill the launch form for that pipeline.
*   Launch the pipeline with your choices to the HTC cluster

Point your browser to https://ondemand.htc.crc.pitt.edu

1. Click Genomics Apps -> nf-core pipelines

2. Choose a pipelne, for example, rnaseq 2.0, click Launch

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-2.png)

3. Click Connect to Nextflow

4. Fill the webform, and click "Launch Workflow".

[nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/2.0)
---------------------------------------------

RNA sequencing analysis pipeline using STAR, RSEM, HISAT2 or Salmon with gene/isoform counts and extensive quality control.

1. Logon ondemand.htc.crc.pitt.edu, Click Files -> Home Directory, Click Change directory and go to your bgfs or zfs folder. You can go to ```/bgfs/genomics/fangping/nf-core-rnaseq``` to see an example.

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-1.png)

Create a folder fastqs, and transfer your fastqs to this folder. 6 paired-end fastqs from GSE155987 have been downloaded to ```/bgfs/genomics/fangping/nf-core-rnaseq/fastqs```.

Differential Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Global LMTK2 Regulatory Network and Its Role in TGF-Î²1 Signaling. Cruz DF, Mitash N, Mu F, Farinha CM, Swiatecka-Urban A. Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 18;11:596861. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.596861.

The raw fastqs files are within this folder.

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-2.png)

2. Samplesheet input

You will need to create a samplesheet file with information about the samples in your experiment before running the pipeline. Use this parameter to specify its location. It has to be a comma-separated file with 5 columns, and a header row specified in [this documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/2.0/usage).

You can use editor on Open Ondemand to edit this file.

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-3.png)

Keep a record of this samplesheet location. You can get its location from the header line of the above editor. For this example, this file is at ```/bgfs/genomics/fangping/nf-core-rnaseq/samples.csv```

3. Reference genome

Create a folder refs and download the reference genome for your samples. I have downloaded Ensembl homo sapiens GRCh38 primary assembly and Ensembl annotation version 103 to ```/bgfs/genomics/fangping/nf-core-rnaseq/refs```

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-4.png)

4. Fill the launch form

Click Genomics Apps -> nf-core pipelines, choose rnaseq 2.0, click Launch, then click Connect to Nextflow

The input field is the absolute path to your sample sheet.

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-5.png)

The minimum reference genome requirements are a FASTA and GTF file, all other files required to run the pipeline can be generated from these files. However, it is more storage and compute friendly if you are able to re-use reference genome files as efficiently as possible. It is recommended to change the save\_reference parameter to be true if you are using the pipeline to build new indices.

fasta and gtf fields are the the absolute path to your fasta and gtf file.

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-6.png)

If you are using the pipeline to build new indices, change save_reference to be True. The star index is available at ```/bgfs/genomics/fangping/nf-core-rnaseq/results/genome/index/star```, and you can use this folder as input to star_index for future runs.

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-7.png)

Choose the aligner and pseudo_aligner.

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-8.png)

Adjust other parameters based on your data analysis goals. The meanings of these parameters are available [here](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/2.0/parameters).

5. Lauch workflow

When you are ready, click Launch workflow.

![](../_assets/img/advanced-genomics-support/nf-core-rnaseq-9.png)

You can close this launch form. You will be notified by emails when your workflow begins and ends.

6. Outputs

[nf-core/mag](https://nf-co.re/mag/2.0.0)
-----------------------------------------

Assembly and binning of metagenomes. nf-core/mag is a bioinformatics best-practise analysis pipeline for assembly, binning, and annotation of metagenomes.

By default, the pipeline currently performs the following: it supports both short and long reads, quality trims the reads and adapters with fastp and Porechop, and performs basic QC with FastQC. The pipeline then:

*   assigns taxonomy to reads using Centrifuge and/or Kraken2
*   performs assembly using MEGAHIT and SPAdes, and checks their quality using Quast
*   performs metagenome binning using MetaBAT2, and checks the quality of the genome bins using Busco
*   assigns taxonomy to bins using GTDB-Tk and/or CAT

Furthermore, the pipeline creates various reports in the results directory specified, including a MultiQC report summarizing some of the findings and software versions.
