# Resource Descriptions For Writing Proposals

## Useful Resource Information For Writing External Proposals
The information below may be of use to you in drafting proposals or other documents calling for descriptions of 
Pitt CRC computational resources available to researchers.

## Brief Text Description of CRC Resources
Access to computing hardware, software, and research consulting are provided through the Pitt Center for Research 
Computing (Pitt CRC). 

The CRC provides state-of-the-art high performance computing (HPC) resources allocated for shared use for campus 
researchers.

The clusters comprise 136 dual 24-core Intel Xeon Gold Ice Lake, 22 dual 32-core Intel Xeon Platinum Ice Lake, 58 dual 
16-core AMD EPYC Rome, 136 dual 12-core Xeon Gold Skylake, 29 dual 6-core Xeon E5, 20 dual 8-core Xeon E5, 132 dual 
14-core Xeon E5, and 32 dual 10-core Xeon E5 compute nodes, totaling to 18,060 computation-only CPU cores.

There are an additional 32 GPU dedicated nodes with a total of 20 V100 GPUs and 128 A100 GPUs. The nodes have a range 
of 512 GB to 1024 GB per node shared memory. The global storage is comprised of a 130 TB Isilon home space 
(which is backed up), 3 PB ZFS file systems, and a 1.6 PB BeeGFS parallel file system.

The systems are housed at the enterprise-level Network Operations Center (NOC) and are administered jointly with 
Pitt IT. Pitt IT maintains the critical environmental infrastructure (power, cooling, networking, and security) and 
administers the cluster operating systems and storage backups. CRC interfaces directly with researchers and provides 
software installation services, training workshops, and personalized consultation on improving software 
design/performance and computational workflows.

## Technical Support and Funding
The cluster computes nodes were purchased with funds provided by the University and by faculty researchers, and are 
housed at the enterprise-level Network Operations Center (NOC), administered jointly with Pitt IT.

Pitt IT maintains the critical environmental infrastructure (power, cooling, networking, and security) and administers 
the cluster operating systems and storage backups.

CRC interfaces directly with researchers and provides software installation services, training workshops, and 
personalized consultation on improving software design/performance and computational workflows. The road map for 
research computing infrastructure is developed jointly by CRC and CSSD to meet the emerging needs of researchers at 
the University.

Connectivity between the NOC and the main campus is via two 100Gbps fibers and to Internet2 via 100Gbps.

The global storage consists of a 130 TB Isilon home ("ihome") space (which is backed up), 3 PB ZFS file systems, 
a 1.6 PB BeeGFS ("bgfs") parallel filesystem, and 1 PB iXsystems enterprise storage. 

The cluster operating systems is Redhat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. A very wide range of major software packages are 
licensed and installed on the cluster, ranging from quantum mechanics (e.g., Gaussian, Molpro, VASP, CP2K, QMC), to 
classical mechanics (e.g., NAMD, LAMMPS, Amber), to continuum mechanics (e.g., Abaqus, ANSYS, Lumerical), to genomics 
analysis suits (e.g., Tophat/Bowtie, CLCb Genomics Server).

This infrastructure is designed for future scaling via additional resources funded by research instrumentation grants, 
internal University funds, or faculty contributions from grants or start-up funds.
